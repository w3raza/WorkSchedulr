The web application for managing work schedules is an advanced tool designed to enhance work efficiency in various types of companies. The key component of the application is an integrated authorization system that ensures secure access for individual users and enables them to be assigned to specific projects. Each user, once logged in, has access to a personal calendar where they can register their daily tasks and indicate which projects were undertaken during a given period. This application also includes administrative functionalities that allow management staff to effectively monitor the actions of all employees assigned to projects under their supervision. This contributes to increased organizational efficiency and optimization of operational procedures. An additional advantage is the automated generation of monthly reports in PDF format, which present detailed salary calculations for individual employees, taking into account the specifics of their employment contracts.
